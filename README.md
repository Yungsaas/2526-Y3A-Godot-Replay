The Godot-Replay project was started as a University project in 2025.

We wanted to create an easy to use plug in that extends Godot by adding new node types that enable users to implement replay features such as:
- [General replay recording](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Recording#recorder-base)
- [Instant replay](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Recording#instant-replay-recorder)
- [Auto clipping](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Recording#clip-recorder)
- [Ghost players](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Ghost-players)

As well as:
- [Being able to control replays by using a timeline slider](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Replaying#replay-controller)
- [Saving replays as json files](https://github.com/Yungsaas/2526-Y3A-Godot-Replay/wiki/Replaying#replay-data-in-json)


A full list of features can be found below:
